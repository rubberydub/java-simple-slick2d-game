This is a simple 2D game in Java and slick2d.

It has both Eclipse and IDEA project files and the required libraries (slick2d and lwjgl) included. Simply inport the project into Eclipse or IDEA, include the libraries, and run.

I wrote this during my studies for the University of Melbourne class Object Oriented Software Development.

The game involves finding a few artefacts and basic combat. Talk to the NPCs (by walking up to them) for the locations of the artefacts. Attack by holding 'a' when adjacent to an enemy.
